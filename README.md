# MaxQuiz Rulebook

Over the course of the next month, starting with July 2020, we will be bringing you a new quiz competition every week, with a champion crowned every Friday.
There will be 3 questions every week, so make sure to follow us to receive notifications when the questions are published. A form will accompany each question, where you will fill in your reply.
‚ùó Any other medium used to send replies (private messages or comments) will not be taken into consideration as a valid reply in the contest.
Make sure you answer correctly (and fast) in the form we will share with you. If we have a tie, the person with the fastest answers throughout the game wins the weekly quiz.
At the end of each week, the person with the most correct answers wins the weekly competition. We will have a new quiz contest each week, so you have plenty of chances to win. üèÜ
